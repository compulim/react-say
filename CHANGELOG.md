## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2020-08-06

### Fixed

- Use `new CustomEvent()` and fallback to `document.createElement` for custom events, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#22](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/22), [#23](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/23), and [#24](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/24)

## [2.0.0] - 2019-11-19

### Breaking changes

- Now requires React 16.8.6 or up
- Updates to `<Say>` component
   - Renamed prop `speak` to `text`
   - Will no longer renders its children
- Updates to `<SayButton>` component
   - Renamed prop `speak` to `text`
- `Composer` signature is being updated
   - New `synthesize` function to replace `speak` and `cancel`
      - When called, it will return `{ cancel: Function, promise: Promise }`
      - `cancel`, when called, will cancel the utterance. If the utterance is being synthesized, it will be stopped abruptly
      - `promise` will be resolved when the utterance is synthesized or errored
   - `cancel` and `speak` is removed because the newer `synthesize` function offer same functionality with simplified interface
- All React components now accepts `ponyfill` instead of `speechSynthesis` and `speechSynthesisUtterance`
   - Using browser speech would become as simple as `<Say ponyfill={ window }>`

### Changed

- Update build scripts to publish `/packages/component/package.json`, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim) in [PR #17](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/17)
- Rework of all components, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim) in [PR #17](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/17)
   - Support nested `<Context>` and `<Composer>`
      - Nested context will share the same queue, with different ponyfills
      - If not ponyfill is specified, it will inherit from its parent, or default to browser-based speech
      - Upgraded `<Composer>` component from class component to functional component
   - Added new `useSynthesize()` hook, which returns a function to queue an utterance
      - `synthesize(utteranceOrText: (SpeechSynthesisUtterance | string), progressFn: () => void) => void`
   - New `<SayUtterance>` component to synthesis `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` instead of text
      - `<Say>` is being refactored to use `<SayUtterance>` to simplify the codebase
      - `<SayButton>` is being refactored to use `<Say>` to simplify the codebase

## [1.2.0] - 2019-05-28
### Changed
- Added babel-runtime dependency, by [@corinagum](https://github.com/corinagum) in [PR #5](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/5)
- Bumped dependencies by `npm audit` in [PR #9](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/9)

### Fixed
- Fix [#8](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/issues/8) by removing workaround for Chrome bug, in [PR #7](https://github.com/compulim/react-say/pull/7)

### Changed
- Bump to [`event-as-promise@1.0.5`](https://npmjs.com/package/event-as-promise/v/1.0.5)

### Added
- Utterance queue are now controlled by `<Composer>` instance, instead of native `speechSynthesis` for better browser compatibility
   - Chrome: does not fire `start` and `end` events if `speak`/`cancel` are called too fast
   - Safari: does not play audio or `start` event if the first utterance is not triggered by user event
- Unmounting elements will cancel the speech in progress or pending speech
